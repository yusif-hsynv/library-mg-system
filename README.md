## üß† Book Management Logic Overview
When creating or updating a book:
1. The system validates that all provided **author IDs** are active.  
2. It checks that the **book title** is valid and not null.  
3. It allows assigning a **User** (borrower) if applicable.  
4. The system maps entities to DTOs using builder patterns and returns responses in a unified format.  
5. Books and related entities are stored and retrieved from the database with active status filtering.
